# Planr Browser QA

Exercise the real browser surface directly and return useful findings from the current request and
repository context.

## Establish the target

Infer the routes, user journeys, runtime command, and relevant viewports from the request and
repository. Ask one concise question only when the target or required credentials cannot be
inferred. Never persist credentials, cookies, or session secrets.

## Run focused browser checks

1. Start or reuse the project's documented local runtime.
2. Exercise the requested route and the shortest meaningful happy path.
3. Check navigation, forms, responsive layout, keyboard access, visible focus, accessible names,
   console errors, failed requests, and loading or error states that are relevant to the change.
4. When a browser capability is unavailable, report the exact missing capability and provide the
   smallest runnable fallback; do not invent a PASS.
5. Remain report-only. When the user also wants fixes, return reproducible findings that a coding
   workflow can act on, then rerun Browser QA after those changes are available.

## Return

- **Outcome:** pass, issues-found, or blocked, with one sentence.
- **Coverage:** routes, journeys, viewports, and checks actually exercised.
- **Findings:** prioritized reproducible problems with path or UI location and expected behavior.
- **Fixes:** changed files and verification, or none.
- **Issues:** missing capability or unresolved risk, or none.
