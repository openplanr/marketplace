# OpenPlanr Artifact

Use the deterministic `openplanr artifact` utility when it is installed. Never
relaunch the active coding agent from inside this skill.

1. For local review, run `openplanr artifact <file>` or
   `openplanr artifact open <file>`. Use `--no-open --json` in headless sessions.
   Generic artifacts default to the edge-to-edge `document` presentation. Use
   `--presentation canvas` only for an explicitly spatial or zoomable review,
   or `--presentation document` to force the reading surface.
2. For a diagram manifest or authored bundle, read
   [diagram-sharing.md](references/diagram-sharing.md). `openplanr artifact share
   <manifest-or-bundle>` creates a native permanent encrypted review with a stable
   URL and a separately entered access token. Use the local **Share diagram**
   dialog to copy it. Publish only an explicitly requested update with `openplanr
   artifact publish <manifest-or-bundle>`; synchronize feedback with `openplanr
   artifact sync <manifest-or-bundle>`. Verify the actual shared native canvas,
   fonts and source revision before describing the hosted result as verified.
   Sharing is always explicit. Run `openplanr artifact share <file>` only after the
   user asks to share. Before sharing or publishing a design document, read
   [design-sharing.md](references/design-sharing.md) and author or refresh its
   sibling `review-context.json` in this active host session. Ground the welcome
   purpose and up to three consequential review questions in that design's brief;
   preserve existing guidance and never invent requirements. Render and inspect
   the updated context before sharing. For a design document this creates a permanent encrypted
   design review with a stable URL and a separately entered generated access
   token. Owner credentials save privately outside the project; copy the reviewer
   token through the studio's Share dialog, never put it in a URL or ordinary
   command output. Publish an explicitly requested update with
   `openplanr artifact publish <design-document.json>`; synchronize reviewer feedback
   with `openplanr artifact sync <design-document.json>`. Hosted sharing requires the
   configured compatible service. An unavailable service must be reported, not
   described as a successful share. Generic HTML retains its existing expiring
   live-room and `--snapshot` fragment/short-link behavior; reviewer, owner-verdict,
   and management authority remain separate.
3. For returned feedback, run `openplanr artifact import <review-url>`. Do not add
   `--allow-stale` by default. Show the stale-review preview and, when the user
   has not already chosen, use the host's native question UI to offer import or
   skip.
4. Export a completed local session with
   `openplanr artifact export <session-id> --format json|markdown`.
5. If the pipeline package is unavailable, report the exact corrective command
   printed by `openplanr`; do not bypass the runtime lock or managed state.

Local review is loopback-only. Opening, approving, finishing, or importing an
artifact never publishes it automatically.

For generic HTML, the CLI bundles complete local HTML/CSS/JavaScript before
review or sharing and runs it inside an invisible opaque-origin sandbox. Native
diagram reviews mount only validated passive SVG or a read-only authoring
projection; sharing never grants source-edit permission. This is private review, not
standalone website hosting; never describe a review URL as deploying the source
artifact.

For explicitly configured company workspaces, read
[company-review.md](references/company-review.md) before selective publication,
company review, or local proposal application. This pre-release route has
separate permissions and storage from encrypted token shares.

## Return

Lead with what was opened, shared, imported or exported and the confirmed revision
or session. Link the actual review URL or exported file; never print capability
tokens or private owner credentials. Distinguish successful service operations
from preparation and browser verification from validation alone. For partial or
blocked work, name the remaining step and exact retry or recovery action, retaining
the useful local result. Keep detailed diagnostics in their existing records;
different summary wording never repeats a publish or import operation.
