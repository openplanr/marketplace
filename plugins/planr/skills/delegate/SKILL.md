# Planr Delegate

Delegate one coherent repository scope through the user's installed native CLI.
The delegate owns investigation, implementation, build/test and correction. The
parent owns scope, complete context, independent review, acceptance and integration.
Ordinary implementation remains with `planr-ship`.

## Start

Resolve [runner.mjs](scripts/runner.mjs) from this installed skill. Call it through
Node with one JSON object on stdin. `probe` discovers Node 20+, Git, installed
CLIs and optional profiles; an OpenPlanr checkout or public CLI command is not
needed. Reuse normal signed-in authentication. Honor an explicit engine/profile,
then a saved choice or the sole installed engine; ask only when ambiguous.
Native runs need no enrollment or renewal. See [onboarding](references/operator-guide.md)
for private helper inputs and optional model/configuration profiles. Read the
[adapter contract](references/adapter-protocol.md) when diagnosing native CLI compatibility.

Read the requested task, binding repository instructions and relevant source/tests.
Build the [complete capsule](references/capsule-contract.md), including required
ignored planning files. Use a short brief and ordered index, retaining every
required file without repeating its full contents in the prompt. Native repository
exploration is allowed under the selected harness's permissions.

Call `prepare` with the engine/profile, context and explicit integration scope.
Show its engine, model selection, known provider or native-managed routing,
trusted configuration, working directory and context inventory once before
`dispatch`. Trusted hooks, plugins and MCP may execute code or contact additional
services. Integration scope limits accepted changes; a worktree is not an OS sandbox.

Prepare dependencies/build prerequisites once in the owned worktree, using
`prepare-worktree` and parent-selected structured commands when needed. Preparation
is attributed internally; tracked changes join the scoped candidate. There is no
digest-acceptance step or permanently frozen setup baseline. See
[worktree custody](references/worktree-custody.md) for preparation attribution and cleanup.

## Run and review

Use the returned pinned helper for subsequent actions. `dispatch`, bounded `wait`
and `status` expose the exact session, native progress, inactivity and phase timings.
Native tools, permissions, configuration and implementation loops remain native.
Do not add bypass/force/yolo flags, blanket tool exclusions or silent model fallbacks.
Local backend probes are compatibility diagnostics, not a separate execution policy.

Surface permission requests/denials as attention states. Resolve them through the
native harness, then `resume` the recorded session with the answer or correction.
Never substitute the latest session. Send actual review findings to the delegate;
do not quietly implement its source changes yourself. Native summaries may be plain
text; formatting never requires a corrective turn. See [lifecycle](references/run-handoff.md).

Once execution stops, inspect the observed patch through the pinned
[integration helper](scripts/integrate.mjs). Select independent commands from the
task/repository, using `{ executable, args, cwd, timeoutMs? }`. Review, verify and
accept the actual candidate under the parent host's execution controls. Source
changes caused by preparation or checks require another review. Failed checks
remain blocked; baseline comparison is an explicit diagnostic action. See
[verification and integration](references/integration-review.md).

`apply` leaves an uncommitted local diff and saves the five-field report and evidence.
Successful native integration removes only the owned worktree unless retention was
requested. Failed/interrupted worktrees remain available. `status` recovers the
report after cleanup. Planning updates are report-only. Commit, landing, publication
and deployment remain separately authorized actions.
