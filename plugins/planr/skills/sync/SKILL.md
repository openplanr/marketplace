# OpenPlanr Sync

Reconcile local planning artifacts and, when requested, GitHub or Linear state.
Reason about conflicts in this active session; deterministic mapping and GitHub
transport may use a host connector or the packaged [sync helper](scripts/sync.mjs).
Local and GitHub work never require the OpenPlanr CLI.

Resolution order:

1. use a host-native GitHub or Linear connector when available;
2. otherwise, for GitHub, use the packaged deterministic helper;
3. otherwise, for Linear, use the `openplanr linear` terminal utility when the user has
   installed it; `openplanr github` and `openplanr sync` are optional equivalents for the rest.

Linear through the CLI:

- the user runs `openplanr linear init` in a terminal once; it prompts for a personal
  access token, which the CLI stores;
- audit with `openplanr linear sync --dry-run`, which reads Linear without writing;
- before a real `openplanr linear sync`, ask how conflicts should resolve and pass
  `--on-conflict local` or `--on-conflict linear`; without a prompt it favors Linear;
- `openplanr linear push <artifact-id>` creates or updates Linear issues; preview with
  `--dry-run`. Quick tasks and backlog items need `linear.standaloneProjectId` in the
  project config when no terminal prompt is available.

Audit is read-only by default. Apply local changes only when the request asks for
reconciliation, and push remote changes only when the request asks for external
synchronization. If credentials are unavailable, complete local reconciliation
and report only the external step that could not run.

## Return

Lead with what is aligned, repaired or still blocked. Summarize aligned, locally
repairable, conflict and unavailable counts; link changed paths or remote items
by purpose. State what was actually validated or synchronized and distinguish
local success from an unavailable remote step. Give each material conflict its
impact and recovery action, with one most useful next step. Keep full mapping
and diagnostics in their existing records. Different chat wording never causes
a second synchronization or a corrective run.

When the OpenPlanr dashboard is running, the reconciled graph is browsable at
`#/overview` and recent changes at `#/activity`. This is navigation only.
